Data provided for the C_rate of 0.5 and 1.5
Task is to tarin the existing data using CNN model and optimize it's coefficient of determination(r^2)
using the pre-trained model, generate data for unknown value of C_rate = 1, C_rate =2
Comapre with the actual data and measure various statistical parameters to check the strength of the model
